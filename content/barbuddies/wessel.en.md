Heya! I'm Wessel, 24 years old and I study Aerospace engineering. When I joined DWH by joining the KMG, the
enthusiasm coming from the members and the open and loving atmosphere made me feel at home straight away! I also
started helping with parties and other activities and by doing so I got to know the association well pretty quickly
and saw the power in our diverse association, everybody chipping in with their talents which results in very awesome
activities! For me DWH feels as one big family where everybody has their own cozy place and I would love to 
help you find yours at DWH!
