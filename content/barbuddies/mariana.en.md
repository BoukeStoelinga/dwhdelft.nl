Hello! I’m Mariana, I’m in my early thirties, from Portugal and I have been living in the Netherlands for 6 years. I
studied here at TU Delft and then I stayed for work. I joined DWH early on and was on the board of Outsite for a year
and I currently help with the women’s events. I’ve met many good friend through DWH and I’m always glad to meet new
people and introduce them to DWH since it helped me so much when I came to the Netherlands.
