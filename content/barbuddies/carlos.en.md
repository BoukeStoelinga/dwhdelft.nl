Hey hola! I'm Carlos, a 24-year-old Spaniard, studying MSc Design for Interaction. I've been in DWH for a bit 
over three years now, and have found not only good people; but also an amazing opportunity. An opportunity to 
exchange experiences and enrich each other's lives, a way to get to know people outside your own bubble, your own 
country, your own culture. Also bartending is just fun af. I can introduce you to the grooviest (do folks say that 
anymore?) people; and have long (and fiery) debates about activism, art or music. Or basically any other thing. If 
you're feeling isolated or insecure, I think coming to DWH and letting yourself be warmly welcomed is one of 
the best things you can do.
