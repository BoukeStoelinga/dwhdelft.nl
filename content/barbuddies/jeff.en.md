Hi, my name is Jeff. I'm in my late twenties, and I study Computer Science at TU Delft. I've been a member of DWH
for a few years now. I'm a regular at the EatingOUT on Tuesdays, but I'm happy to be your barbuddy on a Thursday. I
remember how jittery I was walking into the bar for the first time, and that was for the introduction group. That
turned out to be a great decision though, because DWH is just a really nice place with lovely people and fun
activities.
