Hey, I am Hidde. I am 24 years old and studying for a master’s degree in Applied Mathematics, the probability track.
I first came to DWH around 3 years ago, but it wasn’t until last year that I became a lot more active; I am 
often a volunteer during events, joined various committees and am now also a barbuddy. This is a huge difference with 
the first few years that I visited DWH. I often sat alone and didn’t talk much with other people, since I
didn’t really feel like I knew them. This is where a barbuddy comes in! As your barbuddy, I can introduce you to all 
kinds of people from DWH, including myself of course, and make sure you get to know them and they get to know 
you. Then the next time you decide to visit, you won’t feel like you’re standing in between a group of strangers, but 
hopefully will see some nice, familiar faces.
