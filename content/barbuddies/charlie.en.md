Hi, I'm Charlie. I'm 18 years old and I study Applied Mathematics at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. I've 
only been a member for about a year, but I'm already sure I'll be here for many more to come! I've become an active 
member; I regularly volunteer as a bartender, organised the OWee once, and am currently on the board of Outsite. 
When I first came to the bar I was welcomed by some lovely people who made me feel at home, and I hope to now do 
that for others. You'll find me on almost every barnight, and I'm always happy to have a chat!
