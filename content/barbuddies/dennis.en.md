Hello, I’m Dennis! I’m still in the beginnings of my thirties and travel all over Europe on a daily basis. I’ve been
an active volunteer for this association for a couple of years now. I have organized introduction groups an all kind
of other activities. I also gave education classes at schools about sexual diversity. I would like to be your barbuddy
because it’s a nice spot to hang out and I’ve met a lot of new and interesting people within this association.
