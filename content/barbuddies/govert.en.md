Hello I’m Govert, at the start of my thirties. I study architecture and I’m a teacher a high school. I’m a very active
volunteer within DWH. In my opinion, DWH stands for a nice and really diverse group of people. A place to organize 
lots of things and also a place to learn a lot about yourself. I really like meeting new people and introducing them 
to this awesome association.
