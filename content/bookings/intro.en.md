# **Welcome** back

We are happy to welcome you again in these times of corona! Although it will be different than usual,
you can enjoy a fun bar evening, a cool movie or a nice meal with your friends at our building.

We ask you to pay special attention to a few matters. First of all, we appreciate if you make a
**table booking**, you can do so below. Bookings are individual and upon entrance you can choose
your seat at one of our tables for 2-4 persons (everybody will sit 1.5 metres apart). Are you
visiting with somebody from your own household? Then we have several seats for two persons available,
where you are allowed to stay within 1.5 metres of each other. You are also welcome without a booking,
in that case we will make a booking for you **on the spot**.

Upon entrance we ask you to desinfect your hands, afterwards you can choose the seat you would like to
sit. At the barevening you will be served at your table, with this measure we want to prevent you from
walking too much and crossing paths with other visitors. Aside from this, we ask you to not keep the
aisles occupied when it's not necessary: you are not suppose to have conversations at other tables.
This way, we can keep it **safe and responsible** for everybody.

**Face masks are mandatory** while you're not at your table. Don't forget to use your mask while
visiting the toilet or leaving the bar.

Do you have questions or a nice suggestion? Contact us via the information at the bottom of this page.
