# **Welcome** back

We are happy to welcome you again in these times of corona! Although it will be different than usual,
you can enjoy a fun bar evening, a cool movie or a nice meal with your friends at our building.

We appreciate it if you make a **table booking**, you can do so below. Bookings are individual and upon
entrance you can choose your seat at one of our tables (everybody will sit 1.5 metres apart). You are also
welcome without a booking, in that case we will make a booking for you **on the spot** as long
as we have space left.
