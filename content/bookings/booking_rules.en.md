# **Book a table** in times of COVID-19

On the left you can make a reservation for a seat during one of our events. To keep it as safe and
fair as possible for everybody, we apply the following measures.

* The reservation expires 1 hour after the start of the timeslot
* Moving a reservation is possible by cancelling via the confirmation mail and making a new
  reservation
* Two-seaters are meant for people from the same household
* If there are no two-seaters available anymore and you want to come with two persons, you can make
  two individual reservations. If it is possible, you can still sit together.

> We understand that these measures may not be the most ideal measures for everybody. When possible
> and if necessary, we will adjust the measures to keep it as fun as possible for everybody. Any
> suggestions are always welcome via the contact details below.
