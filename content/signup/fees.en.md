The contribution fee of DWH is a minimum of € 48,50 / € 25,00  per year. A higher amount is of course very
welcome.

In a general assembly meeting, it was decided that the price differentiation for the membership fee is based on
the ability to pay. In order not to make it too complicated, we use the following rule of thumb: For people aged
under 25 or from pension age, the reduced fee of at least € 25,00 is applied.
All other members pay the standard fee of € 48,50.

There are exceptions:
* People who would get the reduced rate but earn enough to pay for the standard rate, should pay the standard
  rate.
* People who would not get the reduced rate but can’t financially cope with paying the standard rate can
  contact the treasurer.
* When there is a change in the situation that would effect any of the above exceptions, it should be reported
  to the treasurer.
