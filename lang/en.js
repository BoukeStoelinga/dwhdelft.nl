    text: `Outsite is the part of DWH (Delftse Werkgroep Homoseksualiteit) specially for LGBT+ youth. We are there for
      everybody who identifies as such. As a society we organise all kinds of activities, ranging from drinks every
      Thursday night and quarterly LGBT+ parties to trips to other cities where we go out together.<br>
      <br>
      These activities are all organized by our fantastic committees and members! The best way to become acquainted with
      Outsite would be to take party in the introduction groups (which we call KMGs) or through the use of the bar buddy
      system: Where we will make sure there is someone ready at the bar to show you around and who could introduce you
      to others.`

      get to know the society but also to become close to other LGBT+ youth, all under supervision of two experienced
      Outsite members. It is a chance to share your coming out stories in a close group and to visit queer parties
      amongst others.`

      Outsite has a confidential counsellor with who you can get in contact about society related and personal issues,
      in case you feel like talking about them.<br>
      <br>
      The contact with the trusted person is strictly confidential. The trusted person does operate separately from the
      Outsite and the DWH boards. Only if the situation requires it, and then only with explicit permission from you,
      issues will be communicated to them.<br>
      <br>
      Donâ€™t be afraid to contact the confidential counsellor about something. The confidential counsellor will take
      every issue serious, and is there to help you.
