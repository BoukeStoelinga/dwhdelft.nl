    DWH: `
      The general chat of the association. Join for event announcements and fun conversations. Slightly less busy and
      aimed more at older members than the Outsite chat.
    `,
    Outsite: `
      Originally the party squad chat but now also another general chat. A lively chat with a lot of conversation which
      tends to have more younger members.
    `,
    Announcements: `
      Don't want to be in the busy Outsite chat but like updates about upcoming youth events? Join the announcements
      chat to receive just those and nothing else.
    `,
    Discord: `
      Want to talk to some people outside of our regular events? Play a game or watch a show together, the discord is
      the place to talk.

  'Groups for <strong>volunteers</strong>': {
    Bartenders: `
      Bartending is one of the most fun things to do, you get to talk to all the people who visit and everyone loves you
      as you're bringing them new drinks! Join this chat if you'd like to bartend sometime!
    `,
    EatingOUT: `
      The chat for everyone interested in cooking on Tuesdays. Are you a kitchen pro or would you like to be? Join the
      chat and cook for a crowd, on your own or with someone more experienced.
    `,
    'Online Activities': `
      While our bar is closed our association continues online! If you'd like to help organise one of the many things
      we do while we exist mostly online, be sure to join this chat and find people to organise it with you :)

      shutOUT anyone)
    `,
    ChocOUT: `
      For all you chocolate and milkshake lovers. Here we discuss everything chocolate, and sometimes we go to Quetzal,

    `,
    'Darkrooms & Daddies': `
      Do you like Dungeons & Dragons or similar roleplaying games? This is the chat for all the alignment memes you
      could ever want and a place to find new people to play with.
    `,
    'Drag Race Gurls': `
      Do you watch all the episodes as well as untucked and do you only speak in Drag Race quotes? If you don't
      already, you will after just one week in this chat ;)
    `,
    'Gender Blender': `
      Are you trans, non-binary or gender non-conforming? Join the Gender Blender and talk all about binders, the
      spinniest of dresses, or all the weird stuff cis people asign gender to, all among friends.
    `,
    'Minecraft/Among Us': `
      Whether it's Minecraft build contests and chilling with the bees in the bee sanctuary, or figuring out sis from 
      sus in Among Us, this chat is for all you gaymers out there.
    `,
    'Politics & Discussion': `
      If you like to discuss the latest in queer and general politics, discuss topics for hours or are looking for
      people to attend a protest with, this is the place to be.
    `,
    Strijders: `
      Studying can be hard, especially on your own. In this group we plan to study together, at the TU or now in our
      own bar, and even just the fancy coffee breaks are worth it :)
